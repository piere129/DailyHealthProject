# DailyHealthProject
My IOS app for Native Apps 2: iOS, which calculates the caloryamount in your daily meals

DailyHealth is a project that allows you to calculate the exact caloryvalue, based on the fooditems you have entered. Choose out of multiple categories of food (such as drinks, meat, fruit, ...), add them to a list and the calculator will do the rest! 

The result gives you an overview of what you added, how much of that item you have added (in grams or cl) and its' respective calory value. For extra oversight, you can also consult the generated piechart. The app is also runnable in any screen-format, as well in portrait- as landscape-mode.

# How to install:

To install, simply clone the directory in your folder and run "DailyHealth.xcworkspace". This is necessary to get the chart working. Compile the code and that's it!
